What are Unemployment Benefits?
Unemployment benefits are temporary income for eligible workers who lost their job (or had hours reduced) through no fault of their own. You get from $40 to $450 each week, depending on how much you earned in the past 18 months. Our Unemployment Benefit Calculator helps estimate your benefit amount. It takes about three weeks to process your benefit application and make the first payment. To avoid confusion, please carefully read all emails and mail communications we send you. Contact us to fix any errors right away.
You may also be able to attend school or training while receiving unemployment benefits. Learn more about California Training Benefits.
Am I Eligible?
To receive benefits, you must meet all of the following requirements:
Have a Social Security number.
Have authorization to work in the United States (if not a US citizen).
Have earned enough wages during a specific period of time based on your earnings over the past 18 months. This is called the base period. See How Unemployment Insurance Benefits Are Computed (DE8714AB) (PDF).
Totally or partially unemployed.
Unemployed through no fault of your own.
Physically able to work.
Available for work.
Looking for work each week.
Ready and willing to accept work right away.
If you are unsure if you are eligible to receive unemployment benefits, apply. We will let you know if you meet eligibility requirements. Learn more about how we determine eligibility.
Even if you quit, were fired, or were incorrectly classified by your employer as an independent contractor, you may still qualify for benefits. There is no penalty for applying even if we determine you are not eligible.

Unemployment Eligibility Requirements
To get unemployment benefits, you must meet all requirements when you apply and when you certify for benefits.
Requirements to Apply
When you apply for unemployment benefits, you must:
Have a Social Security number, or have authorization to work in the United States (if not a US citizen).
Have earned enough wages during the base period.
Be fully or partially unemployed.
Be unemployed through no fault of your own.
Be physically able and available to work.
Be looking for work each week.
Be ready and willing to accept work right away.
The base period is a specific 12-month period that tells us if you earned enough to set up an unemployment claim. To learn more, review How Unemployment Benefits are Computed (DE 8714AB) (PDF).
If you qualify, your weekly benefit amount will be between $40 and $450. You can use the unemployment benefit calculator to get an estimate of what you might receive.
If you think you are misclassified as an independent contractor, please apply. We will let you know if you qualify for benefits.
Requirements After You Apply

Weekly Benefits Certification Requirement
Certifying means answering questions every two weeks to show that you are still eligible for payments. To keep receiving benefits, you need to meet the requirements each week you certify. You must be:
Physically able and available to work.
Looking for work each week.
Ready and willing to accept work right away.
To get benefits when you are not working or are working part-time, you must certify for benefits each week by submitting a certification online, by phone, or by mail.
If you answer incorrectly or miss a certification, your claim could be delayed. For help, see Understanding the Certification Questions or Unemployment Benefit Certification Question Information (YouTube).
If your answers show you did not meet the eligibility requirements, we will need more information. We will either schedule you for a phone interview, email you a questionnaire, or mail a Request for Eligibility Information (DE 4365FF). For more information, see Unemployment Determinations and Eligibility.
Note: You must serve a one-week unpaid waiting period on your claim before getting paid. You also need to certify and meet all eligibility requirements during this week. Your first certification will usually include the one-week unpaid waiting period and one week of payment if you meet the eligibility requirements for both weeks. Certify for benefits every two weeks to continue receiving benefit payments.
Work Search Requirement
To be eligible for benefits, most people are required to search for suitable work and show they are trying to find a job. We suggest you keep a record of your job search dates and contacts. This may help you if we have to contact you about your eligibility for benefits.
Your Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award (DE 429Z) will include work search instructions. For more information, see Job Seekers: Returning to Work.
Important: Most people are required to register for CalJOBS and create an online resume for employers to see. You need to do this within 21 days of receiving your Notice of Requirement to Register for Work (DE 8405) form. If you miss this step, your benefits could be delayed or stopped. Watch How to Register for CalJOBS and Post a Resume (YouTube) for guidance.
What Happens If You Quit or Get Fired
If you quit your job or are fired, we will need to check your eligibility. We will either send you an email questionnaire, mail you a Request for Eligibility Information (DE 4365FF) to complete, or schedule a phone interview. If you quit, you need to show that you had a good reason. If you are fired, your employer must prove there was misconduct. For more information, see Unemployment Determinations and Eligibility.
