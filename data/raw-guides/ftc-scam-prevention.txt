BCP Staff

Millions of people use online dating apps or social networking sites to meet someone. But instead of finding romance, many find a scammer trying to trick them into sending money. Read about the stories romance scammers make up and learn the number one way to avoid a romance scam.What Is a Romance Scam?The Lies Romance Scammers TellHow to Avoid Losing Money to a Romance ScammerHow to Report a Romance Scam What Is a Romance Scam?You meet someone special on a dating website or app. Soon they want to email, call, or message you off the platform. They say it’s true love, but they live far away — maybe for work or because they’re in the military. Then they start asking for money. Maybe it’s for a plane ticket to visit you. Or emergency surgery. Or something else urgent.Romance scammers create fake profiles on dating sites and apps or contact you through popular social media sites like Instagram or Facebook. The scammers strike up a relationship with you to build up trust, sometimes talking or chatting several times a day. Then, they make up a story and ask for money.People reported a record $547 million in losses to romance scams in 2021. That’s up about 80% from the reports the FTC got in 2020. In 2021, people reported paying romance scammers more with gift cards than with any other payment method. The 2021 reports also showed that cryptocurrency payments were the most costly.The Lies Romance Scammers TellRomance scammers adjust their story to what they think will work in each situation.Scammers say they can’t meet you in person. They might say they’re living or traveling outside the country, working on an oil rig, in the military, or working with an international organization.Scammers will ask you for money. Once they gain your trust, they’ll ask for your help to pay medical expenses (for them or a family member), buy their ticket to visit you, pay for their visa, or help them pay fees to get them out of trouble. They may even offer to help you get started in cryptocurrency investing.Scammers will tell you how to pay. All scammers, not just romance scammers, want to get your money quickly. And they want your money in a way that makes it hard for you to get it back. They’ll tell you to wire money through a company like Western Union or MoneyGram, put money on gift cards (like Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, or Steam) and give them the PIN codes, send money through a money transfer app, or transfer cryptocurrency. Scammers do these things to pressure you into acting immediately by paying money. But it’s a scam. How to Avoid Losing Money to a Romance ScammerHere’s the bottom line: Never send money or gifts to a sweetheart you haven’t met in person.If you suspect a romance scam:Stop communicating with the person immediately.Talk to someone you trust. Do your friends or family say they’re concerned about your new love interest?Search online for the type of job the person has plus the word “scammer.” Have other people posted similar stories? For example, search for “oil rig scammer” or “US Army scammer.”Do a reverse image search of the person’s profile picture. Is it associated with another name or with details that don’t match up? Those are signs of a scam.How to Report a Romance ScamIf you paid a romance scammer with a gift card, wire transfer, credit or debit card, or cryptocurrency, contact the company or your bank right away. Tell them you paid a scammer and ask them to refund your money.If you think it’s a scam, report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. Notify the social networking site or app where you met the scammer, too.

Recognizing these common signs of a scam could help you avoid one.Four Signs That It’s a ScamHow To Avoid a ScamReport Scams to the FTC
Scammers Are Impersonating the FTCThe FTC will never threaten you, say you must transfer your money to “protect it,” or tell you to withdraw cash or buy gold and give it to someone. That’s a scam. Report it at ReportFraud.ftc.gov
Four Signs That It’s a Scam1. Scammers PRETEND to be from an organization you know.Scammers often pretend to be contacting you on behalf of the government. They might use a real name, like the FTC, Social Security Administration, IRS, or Medicare, or make up a name that sounds official. Some pretend to be from a business you know, like a utility company, a tech company, or even a charity asking for donations.They use technology to change the phone number that appears on your caller ID. So the name and number you see might not be real.2. Scammers say there’s a PROBLEM or a PRIZE.They might say you’re in trouble with the government. Or you owe money. Or someone in your family had an emergency. Or that there’s a virus on your computer.Some scammers say there’s a problem with one of your accounts and that you need to verify some information.Others will lie and say you won money in a lottery or sweepstakes but have to pay a fee to get it.3. Scammers PRESSURE you to act immediately.Scammers want you to act before you have time to think. If you’re on the phone, they might tell you not to hang up so you can’t check out their story.They might threaten to arrest you, sue you, take away your driver’s or business license, or deport you. They might say your computer is about to be corrupted.4. Scammers tell you to PAY in a specific way.They often insist that you can only pay by using cryptocurrency, wiring money through a company like MoneyGram or Western Union, using a payment app, or putting money on a gift card and then giving them the numbers on the back of the card.Some will send you a check (that will later turn out to be fake), then tell you to deposit it and send them money.How To Avoid a ScamBlock unwanted calls and text messages. Take steps to block unwanted calls and to filter unwanted text messages.Don’t give your personal or financial information in response to a request that you didn’t expect. Honest organizations won’t call, email, or text to ask for your personal information, like your Social Security, bank account, or credit card numbers.If you get an email or text message from a company you do business with and you think it’s real, it’s still best not to click on any links. Instead, contact them using a website you know is trustworthy. Or look up their phone number. Don’t call a number they gave you or the number from your caller ID.Resist the pressure to act immediately. Honest businesses will give you time to make a decision. Anyone who pressures you to pay or give them your personal information is a scammer.Know how scammers tell you to pay. Never pay someone who insists that you can only pay with cryptocurrency, a wire transfer service like Western Union or MoneyGram, a payment app, or a gift card. And never deposit a check and send money back to someone.Stop and talk to someone you trust. Before you do anything else, tell someone — a friend, a family member, a neighbor — what happened. Talking about it could help you realize it’s a scam.Report Scams to the FTCIf you were scammed or think you saw a scam, tell the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.

Scammers advertise jobs the same way honest employers do — online (in ads, on job sites, and social media), in newspapers, and sometimes on TV and radio. They promise you a job, but what they want is your money and your personal information. Here are some examples of jobs scams and advice on how to avoid them.Examples of Job ScamsHow To Avoid a Job ScamAdvice on Finding a JobWhat To Do If You Paid a ScammerReport Job Scams to the FTCLooking for a business opportunity? Before you get into any money-making program, read Multi-Level Marketing Businesses and Pyramid Schemes and When a Business Offer or Coaching Program Is a Scam to make sure you’re not getting into a bogus business opportunity or a scam.Examples of Job ScamsWork-from-home job scamsMany people would like to make money working from home. Scammers know this, so they place ads, often online, claiming that they have jobs where you can make thousands of dollars a month working from home with little time and effort. The job could be anything from reshipping products to selling things to people you know. Sometimes the scammers try to get you interested by saying that you can be your own boss, start your own business, or set your own schedule.But instead of making money, you end up paying for starter kits, so-called training, or certifications that are useless. You might also find that your credit card is charged without your permission, or you get caught up in a fake check scam, where you deposit a check from your new employer, the employer then asks you to send some money back due to “overpayment,” but the check will ultimately bounce, and the bank will want you to repay the full amount of the fake check, while the scammers keep the real money you sent them.If someone offers you a job and claims that you can make a lot of money in a short period of time with little work, that’s almost certainly a scam.Here are some examples of work-from-home job scams:Reshipping scams. If you’re searching for a job online, you might see positions advertised for quality control managers or virtual personal assistants that have been placed by scammers. But here’s how you can tell it’s a reshipping scam: once you’re “hired,” the company says that your “job” is to receive packages at home, throw away the original packaging and receipts, repackage the products, and then reship them to an address they give you.Sometimes the address is overseas. The products are often high-priced goods, like name-brand electronics, bought using stolen credit cards. Reshipping goods is never a real job. That’s simply being part of a scam. Sometimes the company tells you it will send your first paycheck after you work for a month, but the paycheck never arrives. And when you try to contact the company, you’ll find that the phone number is often no longer connected and the website is deactivated. This “job” is a scam, and if you gave your personal information thinking it was for payroll, you may now have an identity theft problem.Reselling merchandise scams. In this scam, you may get a call out of the blue from a stranger offering you a job opportunity. Or you may see an ad online or in your local newspaper. They say you can make money buying brand-name luxury products for less than retail prices, and resell those products for a profit. But after you pay for the products, the package never arrives or, if it does, it’s usually junk.Nanny, caregiver, and virtual personal assistant job scamsScammers post fake job ads for nannies, caregivers, and virtual assistants on job sites. Or they may send emails that look like they’re from someone in your community. The message might also seem to come from someone who is part of an organization you know, like your college or university. If you apply, the person who hires you might send you a check. They’ll tell you to deposit the check, keep part of the money for your services, and send the rest to someone else. That’s a scam. A legitimate employer will never ask you to do that. The check is fake and will bounce, and the bank will want you to repay the full amount of the fake check, while the scammer keeps the real money you sent them. So: if you get an offer that includes depositing a check and then using some of the money for any reason, that’s a scam. Walk away.Mystery shopper scamsGetting paid to shop sounds like a dream job — especially if you’re going to school full-time or looking for a side job. But while some mystery shopping jobs are honest, many are scams. Honest mystery shopping companies won’t ask you to pay for certifications, directories of jobs, or job guarantees. If someone asks you to pay to get a job, that’s a scam. And if they want you to deposit a check and send money back, stop. That’s a sign of a fake check scam. Read Mystery Shopping Scams to learn more.Job placement service scamsWhile many staffing agencies, temporary agencies, headhunters, and other placement firms may deliver honest job search services, others lie about what they will do for you, promote outdated or fake job openings, and charge fees for so-called services. Honest placement firms do not typically charge a fee to job candidates. Instead, the hiring company pays them a fee to find qualified candidates. If a placement firm asks you for a fee — especially one you have to pay in advance — walk away. You’re probably dealing with a scam.Government and postal jobs scamsInformation about job openings with the federal government or U.S. Postal Service is free and available to everyone. And it’s always free to apply for a federal or postal job. Never respond to an ad that promises jobs with the federal government or postal service. And don’t pay a fee to get the job. Those are scams. Use official government websites to find and apply for a job with the federal government at USAJobs.gov, or visit usps.com/employment to find jobs with the U.S. Postal Service.How To Avoid a Job ScamBefore you accept a job offer, take these steps to avoid common job scams:Search online. Look up the name of the company or the person who’s hiring you, plus the words “scam,” “review,” or “complaint.” See if others say they’ve been scammed by that company or person. No complaints? It doesn’t guarantee that a company is honest, but complaints can tip you off to possible problems.Talk to someone you trust. Describe the offer to them. What do they think? This also helps give you vital time to think about the offer.Don't pay for the promise of a job. Honest employers, including the federal government, will never ask you to pay to get a job. Anyone who does is a scammer.Never bank on a “cleared” check. No honest potential employer will ever send you a check to deposit and then tell you to send on part of the money, or buy gift cards with it. That’s a fake check scam. The check will bounce, and the bank will want you to repay the amount of the fake check.Advice on Finding a JobWhen you’re searching for a job, start with safe and reliable sources:USAJobs.gov — This is the federal government’s official site with job openings nationwide.CareerOneStop — Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, CareerOneStop lists hundreds of thousands of jobs. It also links to employment and training programs in each state.USA.gov — Find local government websites, which list any open positions they may have on their websites.Also, when you’re applying for a job, an employer may do a background check. Read Employer Background Checks and Your Rights to learn more.What To Do if You Paid a ScammerNo matter how you paid — debit or credit card, mobile payment app or wire transfer, gift card, cash reload card, or cryptocurrency — immediately contact the company you used to send the money, report the fraud, and ask to have the transaction reversed, if possible. For specific advice on how to reverse different types of payments, read What To Do If You Were Scammed.Report Job Scams to the FTCIf you see a job scam, or lose money to one, report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.
